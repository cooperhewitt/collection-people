These are [people who've had a hand in the Cooper Hewitt collection](http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/) who we _think_
we know about at another institution or in another database of people. **As of
this writing there are some mistakes in this list** but it's mostly correct and
a valuable resource and a step, however, in the right direction.

_This list was generated using some pretty naive code that really only concerned
itself with names and concordances that could be inferred with the simplest of
rulesets. There is lots of work to be done here but we opted for doing the easy
thing first in the service of our collections website so as not to get stuck in
the quicksand of edge cases._

Our hope is that people will use these concordances with their own datasets,
help us improve the data by correcting the mistakes we've let slip through the
cracks and by adding their own concordances for other data sources.

We currently have one or more concordances between Cooper-Hewitt "people" and
six other sources. They are:

* [Freebase](http://www.freebase.com/)

Concordances are listed under the `freebase:id` column. For example
[ch:id=18536279](http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18536279/) is thesame as [freebase:id=m/01hlzm](http://www.freebase.com/m/01hlzm)

* [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/)

`wikipedia:id`

* [Virtual Internet Authority File (VIAF)](http://viaf.org/)

`viaf:id`

* [Library of Congress Name Authority File](http://id.loc.gov)

`lcnaf:id`

* [Museum of Modern Art (MOMA)](http://www.moma.org/)

`moma:id`

* [Indianapolist Museum of Art (IMA)](http://www.imamuseum.org/)

`ima:id`

If you look carefully at our collections website you may notice that we also
claim to have concordances with the [Powerhouse Museum]() in Sydney and the
[Victoria and Albert Museum]() in London.
